2015-07-08	ARM Thumb-32 support.  Reduced number of recursion levels
		from 6 to 5, so that compiler does not exhaust memory.

		- reduced recursion levels
		- added ARM Thumb-32 handling for lolwut(, 1) and (, 2)

		- reduced recursion levels
		- ARM architecture: added ARM mode and Thumb mode handling

		lolwutconf/c++.inc :
		- now handles stuff like --host=armv7-a-linux-gnueabi
		- now tries to turn on Thumb mode when compiling for ARM

		- added a few more printf(...) calls

2015-07-05	Somewhat better support for cross compilation in general.

		  compilation on x86-64

		- lolwut(, 1):
		  - changed threshold for leaq -> leaq + addq/subq split
		    from 0x7fff0000 to 0x70000000
		  - for splits, took addq/subq out of __asm(...) so that g++
		    can move them around
		  - changed %c assembly operand modifier to %a

		include/biting-pear/kthxbai.h :
		- on C++11 compiler, now specially checks for function
		  pointer type and behaves differently in that case
		- code formatting tweaks

		README.md :
		- changed recommended way of assigning values from `var =
		  val' to `var(val)'
		- added mention of function pointers

		test/test-2.ccc ,
		test/test-2.good :
		- initial version

		GNUmakefile :
		- added test-2

		include/biting-pear/kthxbai.h ,
		include/biting-pear/lolwut.h ,
		- added +=, -=, ++, and -- for pointers

		lolwutconf/c++.inc ,
		lolwutconf/configure.inc ,
		lolwutconf/lolwutconf.mk :
		- initial version

		GNUmakefile :
		- moved some logic into lolwutconf/lolwutconf.mk
		- now checks for both <cinttypes> and <inttypes.h>
		- now creates include/biting-pear/derp.h

		configure :
		- moved most logic into lolwutconf/*
		- now checks for both <cinttypes> and <inttypes.h>

2015-06-22	Further internal cleanup.

		include/biting-pear/bbq.h ,
		include/biting-pear/kthxbai.h ,

		  for cross-compilation
		- now uses $(LDLIBS) (and $(LDLIBS_FOR_BUILD)) when linking
		- added support for building outside of source tree, e.g.
		  use of $(VPATH)
		- updated name: helper/postproc.ll -> helper/postproc.lxx

		helper/postproc.lxx :
		- renamed from helper/postproc.ll, to avoid confusion with
		  LLVM files

		include/biting-pear/kthxbai.h ,
		include/biting-pear/lolwut.h ,
		include/biting-pear/omg.h ,
		test/test-1.ccc :
